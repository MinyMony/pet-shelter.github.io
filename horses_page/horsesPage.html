                            <br /><label class="minyTitle">Meet Mr. Snuggles</label>
                            <br />Mr. Snuggles, aka "Snug" came to Lollypop Farm when his owner could no longer physically care for him.
                            <br />Snug foundered a few years ago, but recent xrays after he arrived show no rotation. He can be foot sore, so routine farrier work is important for him.
                            <br />Snug was trail ridden extensively his entire life, but was always anxious and spooky.
                            Because of his feet, and extreme nervousness under saddle, Snug is ready to enjoy retirement.
                            <br />He is low-man on the totem pole in a herd, and has very good ground manners.
                            <br />He's an easy keeper, and enjoys grooming and attention. If you have a grass field, he will need a grazing muzzle to prevent future issues with founder.
                            <br />If you're looking for a snuggle buddy, please consider Mr. Snuggles! Suitable as a Companion Horse Only.

                            <br /> Spirit came to us when her owner could no longer care for her.
                            <br />It was obvious upon her arrival that her previous owner showered her with love and care,
                            and that is why she is such an amazing little horse.
                            <br />Spirit trained at Belmont to race, but never made it to the races.
                            <br />This mare is not your stereotypical "redheaded TB mare".
                            <br />She is sweet, easy going, and always well-behaved during her training sessions.
                            <br />Being away from her friends in the arena doesn't phase her. She lunges like a dream, and so far has been
                            very willing under saddle.
                            <br />Spirit is still very young, and green, so will need a trainer or an Advanced-Intermediate rider working with
                            a trainer to bring her to her full potential.

                            <br />This California-bred mare raced only a handful of times before retiring.
                            <br />She's not had much retraining since her race days, but is ready to go in whatever direction you'd like.
                            <br /> She's a beautiful mover, and is a real looker.
                            Deo would excel in a flatwork career, and possible occasional small jumping.
                            <br />Deo's head-mare in a herd, and gets very bonded to her friends.
                            <br />Her ideal adopter is somebody with a lot of experience retraining OTTB's, and somebody who has a true love of
                            mares (as Deo defines the term "mare").
                            <br />While Deo may be spunky and confident, she also enjoys people and attention.
                            <br />Deo's not the horse for the inexperienced or timid, but if you have the knowledge and the skills to bring
                            a green horse along, you will find you have a great hidden treasure with Deo's Secret!
